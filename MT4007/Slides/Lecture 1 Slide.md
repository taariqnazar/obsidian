# Reproducibility

---
## Reproducibility
- As a statistician/actuary/mathematician, you will do many analyses.
- You will write reports.
- Using Excel might be tempting(Cut & Paste)

---

### Problems
- How did you handle missing data (NA/missing values)?
- How did you transform the data?
- I don't understand the plot, can you create a table?
- Can you reproduce the same result a year later?

---

### Reproducible data analysis
**Reproducibility**  *is the ability to get the same research results or inferences, based on the raw data and computer programs provided by researchers.* (Wikipedia)

- You can never guarantee that you are "correct", but you can document what you did
- The analysis is reproducible.

---
### Reproducible data analysis
- Everything written in code (No cutting & pasting).
- Portable (The code must be executable, on another computer).
- Accessible (Others should easily be able to access and reproduce you analysis).
- Automated from raw data to report (a button press should be enough to generate the final product).

---
# Tools for data analysis

---
### Code
- Python or R.
- Industry standard.
---
### Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas, Numpy & Matplotlib
---
### R
- R Studio / Jupyter Notebooks
- Tidyverse

---
### Reporting
- Markdown

---

### Availability & Accessibility
- An important aspect of making code accessible is making it readable
- It is important to use descriptive comments in your code

---
### Availability & Accessibility
- Making your code available for others
- Documenting versions of your code (version control)
- Github is and established tool for both

---
### Git & Github
- Version control using Git
- Github is an online repository for sharing (mainly) code
- Github makes it easy to collaborate on projects

---
### What to do if you are stuck
- *Google* and *Stack Overflow* is your friend
- Use the moodle page forum

---
### Summary
- Code: Python or R
- Reporting: Markdown
- Availability: Github
