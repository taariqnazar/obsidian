- Re-exam in February <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- A-F<!-- element class="fragment" -->

---

## Project (3 hp, A-F)
- Illuminates a question using a "unique" data material
- Think about topics early <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Short (5 min!) presentation , see timeedit. <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---

## Lectures / Tutorial
- The lectures are not mandatory, but highly recommended.
- All the material will be available online.  <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Traditional Lecture + Tutorial/Demo <!-- element class="fragment" -->

# Reproducibility

---
## Reproducibility
- As a statistician/actuary/mathematician, you will do many analyses.
- You will write reports. <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Using Excel might be tempting(Cut & Paste) <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---

## Problems
- How did you handle missing data (NA/missing values)?<!-- element class="fragment" -->
- How did you transform the data?<!-- element class="fragment" -->
- I don't understand the plot, can you create a table?<!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Can you reproduce the same result a year later?<!-- element class="fragment" -->

---

## Reproducible data analysis
-  **Reproducibility**  *is the ability to get the same research results or inferences, based on the raw data and computer programs provided by researchers.* (Wikipedia) 
- You can never guarantee that you are "correct", but you can document what you did <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- The analysis is reproducible <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---
## Reproducible data analysis
- Everything written in code (No cutting & pasting).
- Portable (The code must be executable, on another computer) <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Accessible (Others should easily be able to access and reproduce you analysis) <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Automated from raw data to report (a button press should be enough to generate the final product) <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---
# Tools for data analysis

---
## Code
- Python or R.
- Industry standard.
---
## Python
- Jupyter Notebooks <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Pandas, Numpy & Matplotlib <!-- element class="fragment" -->
---
## R
- R Studio / Jupyter Notebooks <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Tidyverse <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---
## Reporting
- Markdown, simple markup language, [Try it out](http://writeme.mattstow.com/)
- Popular and Simple
- E.g Obsidian for notetaking, Reveal.js for presentation <!-- element class="fragment" -->
---

## Availability & Accessibility
- An important aspect of making code accessible is making it readable <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- It is important to make your code as descriptive as possible. <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---
## Availability & Accessibility
- Making your code available for others <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Documenting versions of your code (version control)<!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Github is and established tool for both <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---
## Git & Github
- Version control using Git <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Github is an online repository for sharing (mainly) code<!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Github makes it easy to collaborate on projects <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---
## What to do if you are stuck
- *Google* and *Stack Overflow* is your friend 
- Use the moodle page forum <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---
## Summary
- Code: Python or R <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Reporting: Markdown <!-- element class="fragment" -->
- Availability: Github <!-- element class="fragment" -->
