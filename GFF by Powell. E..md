**Green Function**: The Green function $G(x,y)$ is defined for any $x,y \in V$ by setting
$$
G(x,y) = \mathbb{E}_{x}\left[\int_{0}^\infty \mathbb{1}_{\{ X_{t} = y; \tau>t \}} )dt\right]
$$
In plain words $G(x,y)$ is the expected time that the random walk $X$ spends at $y$, when started from $x$, before hitting the boundary.
