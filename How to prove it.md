These are notes on the book **How to prove it** by Velleman.
# Chapter 1 ( Sentential Logic)

We can use logical reasoning to deduce the truth of a statement. Sometimes it is easier to break down a statement from words to placeholders, e.g, P, Q for instance and use these to reason the truth. That is from the *premise* we can arrive at a *conclusion*. The idea is to construct the premise in a way so that if the premise is true then the conclusion is also true (forced). 

What make an argument/statement **valid**? If the conclusion is forced on us by the premise then the argument is valid. An argument is valid if the premises cannot all be true without the conclusion being true as well. That is, in the case that the conclusion is true, all the premises have to be true as well. Otherwise, the argument is invalid.

The statement: 
	It will either rain or snow tomorrow.
	It's too warm for snow.
	Therefore, it will rain

Can be broke down into
	P or Q.
	Not Q.
	Therefore, P.

If we have the premise P,Q,... We can create a truth table to check all the scenarios.
