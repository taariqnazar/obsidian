These are notes on the book **How to prove it** by Velleman.

# Chapter 1 ( Sentential Logic)

We can use logical reasoning to deduce the truth of a statement. Sometimes it is easier to break down a statement from words to placeholders, e.g, P, Q for instance and use these to reason the truth. That is from the *premise* we can arrive at a *conclusion*. The idea is to construct the premise in a way so that if the premise is true then the conclusion is also true (forced). 

The statement: 
	It will either rain or snow tomorrow.
	It's too warm for snow.
	Therefore, it will rain

Can be broke down into
	P or Q.
	Not Q.
	Therefore, P.

 If we have the premis P,Q,... We can create a truth table to check all the scenarios.
