**Definition**
	An operator $A$ is closed if its graph $\Gamma(A) = \{ (x, Ax) \in \mathcal{H} \times \mathcal{H} | x \in D(A)\}$ is a closed subset of $\mathcal{H} \times \mathcal{H}$.

If the domain of $A$ is dense in $\mathcal{H}$ (Why is this necessary?), the domain $D(A^*)$ of the *adjoint operator*  $A^*$ consists of $\phi \in \mathcal{H}$ such that there is $\eta \in \mathcal{H}$ with the property that
$$
(A \psi, \phi) = (\psi, \eta ) \; \forall \psi \in D(A),
$$
and the operator $A^*$ is defined by $A^* \phi = \eta$. 

**Definition**
		An operator $A$ is called *symmetric* if $(A \psi, \phi) = (\psi, A \phi) \quad \forall$
